A fun program written in rust to caculate subnetting vaules.

The program accepts an ipv4 ipaddress/cidr notation as imput and solves for network address, first host, last host, broadcast address, and next subnet address

Notes
Build with rust and cargo
cargo.toml is a file that lists the dependancies
cargo handles the downloading of those things
